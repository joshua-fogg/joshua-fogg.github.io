**interviewers amy try to apply pressure -> assess ability under pressure**
When going into interview:
- [ ] current side-projects
- [ ] Remember why I like coding
- [ ] Take PC with you
- [ ] Take paper && pen: notes && pad
- [ ] 3 paper copies of CV
- [ ] Laptop with project ready, Demo, code and terminal.
- [ ] Layout timeframe.

start of interview:
- [ ] Is interviewer nervous or new to doing this. -> empathise, set them up to interview well.
- [ ] They may not have right perspective for interviewing. -> navigate this. / may not be prepared.
- [ ] If writing code then use PC -> removes semi-colons and formatting issues etc. / could we do it on the computer?? together??
- [ ] Yoman -> generator. type yo generate test --> boilerplate.

**Questions for language:**
- [ ] ask about limitations of question:
    - [ ] scope question(s). - [ ] ie roman numerals, how high to goto.
        - [ ] do I have all the info i need to solve this.
  most are at home.
  no short cuts, high quality.
  Good naming, linting, fix all errors, same indents, spacing consistant.
  --> look for company open source code -> use their linter setup.
  1. [ ] MVP working first.
  2. [ ] Refactor and Tidy.
  3. [ ] Write tests, unit tests.
  4. Use similar stack to company -> use their language
  5. Create another solution. -> shows initiative.
  **Timed Tests:**

 **Un-Timed:**
  complete within a few days. ie 1-2. ie get it thursday and send it in monday. (dont include weekend).

**Variable scoping:**
function scoping -> 
global scoping ->
var vs let && const scopes
**This** keyword: window object, object, null...
Call apply and bind -> differences
Prototype chain && Prototypal inheritance -> JS prototype inheritance.
Inhertiance

Hack Reactor on udacity.

Create simple fullstack app.
Building From Scratch: package.json, react, webpack etc. use minimal boilerplate.
- [ ] think about how to build it quickly, full stack.


**EDA difference:**
- [ ] writing unit tests
- [ ] integration tests
- Differences
- Pair programming experiences: good and bad.
- Friday projects, pair programming.
- GIT on teams, what makes it fall off the rails.
- think about stories: good and bad aspects ive seen about being a dev on a team.
- Agile: retrospectives (ensures continual improvement), sprint planning, uses of these. Swim lanes -> waffel, trello etc.
- Full stack -> written client and serverside code. Differences in coding ability. 
- Debugging on client and server-side. --> powerful --> increases knowledge vs console.log(), Lights on vs Torch in dark room.
- Built many projects -> wireframing, scoping, building practice, personal to friday projects.

Check Technical Tests:
- How loops are done, for vs reduce, functional concepts.
- Map, filter, find, for each.
- nesting is a smell -> makes it unclear.
- keep functions minimal in size, more than 9 nines == look how to break it up.
- Diligent naming: verb if function, singular if singular, plural if array.
- Unit tests.

Interview:
- Are they coding when unpaid? - Love industry? - Get excited -- yo check this!
- dont be afraid that I dont want to giv up on finding a solution to a question.


Questions: indepth questions.
1. how is team structured
2. what is your testing scenario
3. what are your deployment strategies
4. how are you doing continuous depoyment / integration?
5. Do you do charitable donations?
6. Whats your data retention policy? do you mine it, anonymise it?

Tips:
active git profile: top 6, pin to github profile. Readmes, Identify to do list, build up body of work.
