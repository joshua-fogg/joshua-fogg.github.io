  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      7/06/2017
    <p>
      Over the years I have come across many challenges and obstacles. One quote that I have come to find important is:
      <br>
      "A ship in harbor is safe â€” but that is not what ships are built for." - John Augustus Shedd
    </p>
    <p>
      By taking on challenging tasks we grow and discover new treasures, while coming to better understand our own capabilities.
      I have found approaching these challenges with an inquisitive and open mind to be the most beneficial technique to navigate obstacles, as the easiest way is not always the clearest way, and not always the most rewarding or exiciting.
      <br><br>
      <h4>The challenge</h4>
      A more recent challenge I am currently undertaking is the journey of progressing through Enpsiral Developer Academy (EDA) to enter the Tech Industry. The challenge itself was to move to a foriegn city and find an a home base I could afford with what little I had to get me through the EDA course.
      <br><br>
      <h4> The Setup </h4>
      Before the start of the course I was financially void. Initially this year I was based with family in Wellington but since my partner found a job she enjoys in Auckland we decided to move up to have a crack at the big apple.
      <br><br>
      <h4> Challenges Additional Dimensions</h4>
      Initially I couldn't see an option without rushing into a job within the first week of arriving in Auckland and working through the majority of the course. From the previous graduates I was priviledged enough to meet and the reviews I had read online I knew this would be too much to handle with the other challenges. There was the potential for the job to bring it's own problems also.
      <br><br>
      <h4> The Block </h4>
      Within a few days of attempting to tackle this problem I was becomming stressed by knowing of my lack of my finances and the uncertainty in upholding my future plans. Effectively I had become tunnel visioned in my way of thinking to solve the problem. I had become stuck in a box mentally and by doing so I had reduced my capabilities and solution options.
      <br><br>
      <h4> The Solution</h4>
      I took some time off and went outdoors for a bike ride and a run to clear my head. Upon returning from my expedition I contacted my partner and had a talk with her about potential options, trying to use my clear head to look at hints of solutons I could ave missed. It came down to two options, find an affordable way of living for the length of the course or postpone the course until I could build up a financial blanket to cover me for this period. We eventually discovered a new solution that we hadn't thought off, housesitting. This would enable our living costs to be reduced but we wouldn't have a permanent base camp.
      <br><br>
      <h4>Testing the solution</h4>
      The hunt began to investigate and figure out if this solution could tread water. What we discovered is that there are multiple sites and apps to facilitate that do this and that Auckland is the only place in the country that had costs associated with registering for these facilities.
      My partner and I made signed up and started applying to see how much free accomodation tiem we could log up.
      <br><br>
      <h4> Pass or try again </h4>
      After a few meet and greets with potential house owners it seemed we could be able to make this work. I moved up to Auckland into a temporary flat with a friend of a friend and my partner and I began plannig out times frames of different house sits, schedulling owner meets and as it turned out within a few weeks we had the next 3 months planned out. This was enough time to cover the length of the course. Bingo all ships were go!
      <br><br>
        <h4> Learnings </h4>
        With this example I found that what worked best was being able to take a step back, refresh my thinking and re-approach the task at hand.  A clear mindset allowed an alternative solution to be identified, an option that previosuly wasn't visible. Working within a team allowed for a quicker achievement of the goal by giving an environement to  bounce ideas around and to divide up tasks for completion.

  <h1>Problem Solving Techniques and How I've Used Them</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Pseudocode</h3> I have found this great for clarifying what it is I am trying to achieve. I find it especially useful when I lose track of what certain sections of code are doing. It's a ncie way to document it like a walkthrough for easy guidance.
   </li>
   <li>
     <h3>Trying something</h3> has got to be one of the easiest but often forgotten methods. Often I have found that experimenting is the answer because with each failed attempt I get another step closer to understanding how it works. It does require determination and a creative approach though.
   </li>
   <li>
     <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3> aka dumbing it down and making it clear. Pseudocode is great for this and as the Wiki states often just by talking about it the user tends to come across the solution in the process of explaining the problem.
   </li>
   <li>
     <h3>Reading error messages</h3> can be a good way to increase your understanding as they do give a good idea as to what is going on but often it requires a certain leevel of background knowledge to be able to figure it out. However googleing the error can give great results.
   </li>
   <li>
     <h3>Console.logging</h3>helps generate some more 'experimental data' as it were. Console logging allows you to create a list of what issues arrive... I dont use this... like at all.
   </li>

   <li>
     <h3>Googling</h3>definately has to be the most used method I use to seek inspiration and solutions or advice when I am stuck.
   </li>

   <li>
     <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3> is also highly useful. The amount of knowledge and expertise in a group can prove suprising.
   </li>

   <li>
     <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3> yes this is a good way to go. Although I do like to have a good tinker attmept myself first so that I can analyse what the coach does and try to find a learning from it to expand my toolbelt.
   </li>
   <li>
     <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3> is a great way to go as it often lets you explore new approaches by bringing additional data to the forefront. I often use this technique with others to achieve a solution.
   </li>
  <h1>Explain to your non-tech friends</h1>
   <strong><code>.map()</code></strong> is applied to an array or data set. When applied it takes the data points from an array(s) and processes them through a provided function or instruction list and takes the processed data list and turns it into a new data list / array.
   <br>
   <strong><code>.filter()</code></strong> takes a data set and filters the data so that only data elements that match the filter pass through. The data that passes through is then turned into a new data set.
   <br>
   <strong><code>.reduce()</code></strong> causes each arrays data set to be condensed into a single total number. It is kind of like making a batch code on a can of beans. The batch code refers to the year made, batch number and production line. Ie 2017, 0025 and prod 3 becomes 01702503.
