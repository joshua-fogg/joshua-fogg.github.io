  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
<p>
   7/06/2017
</p>
<p>
  Over the years I have come across many challenges and obstacles. One quote that I have come to find important is, "A ship in harbor is safe â€” but that is not what ships are built for."
  <br>
  By taking on challenging tasks we grow and discover new treasures, while coming to better understand our own capabilities.
  I have found approaching these challenges with an inquisitive and open mind to be the most beneficial technique to navigate obstacles, as the easiest way is not always the clearest way, and not always the most rewarding or exiciting.

  A more recent challenge I am currently undertaking is the journey of progressing through Enpsiral Developer Academy (EDA) to enter the Tech Industry. The challenge itself was to move to a foriegn city and find accomodation, while balancing what little savings I had to get me through the EDA course.

  Before teh start of the course and currently I am financially empty so to speak. Initially this year I was based with family in Wellington but since my partner found a job she enjoys in Auckland we decided to move up to have a crack at the big apple.

  Initially I couldn't see an option without rushing into a job within the first week of arriving in Auckland and working through the majority of the course. From the previous graduates I was priviledged enough to meet and reviews I had found online I knew this would be too much to handle in a big city. The job could also have additional problems associated with it.
