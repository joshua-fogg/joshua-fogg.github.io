  <H1> Reflections from Shereed Kitchen on Kitchen vs Table </h1>
<p> <li> Kitchen mindset: what can I create. I have the ability to do and create.
  <li> Table mindset: What will I consume / order. Low outcome long term.
    <li> being able to help and co-construct will give us the greatest creativity and development.

      <p><h2>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
      Well the idea of the Pomodoro didn't quite catch as I think by 25 minutes I would only just be getting fired up on a task.
    Prefering the longer stunts and shring a last name of Fogg... well I went with the Fogg technique.
    Keeping it simple and clear feels this best approach at the present. </p>
      <p> <h2>what did you find interesting? </h2> <p/>
        The diveristy of options availbale was ncie to see. It was good to know that people cna work quite differently.
      <p> <h2> what worked for you?</h2> </p>
      <P> <h2> which will you experiment further with? </h2> </p>
