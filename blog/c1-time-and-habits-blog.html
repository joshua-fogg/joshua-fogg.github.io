      <H1> Reflections from Shereed Kitchen on Kitchen vs Table </h1>
        <li>
          Kitchen mindset: what can I create as I have the ability to do and create.
        </li>
        <li>
          Table mindset: What will I consume / order. Low outcome long term.
        </li>
        <li>
          being able to help and co-construct will give us the greatest creativity and development.

      <h2>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
        Well the idea of the Pomodoro didn't quite catch as I think by 25 minutes I would only just be getting fired up on a task. Prefering the longer stunts and sharing a last name of Fogg... well I went with the Fogg technique. Keeping it simple and clear feels this best approach at the present.  It enalbes me to create clear objectives and be clear about what I am achieving today.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>what did you find interesting? </h2>
        The diveristy of options availbale was nice to see. It was good to know that people can work quite differently.
      </p>
      <p>
         <h2> what worked for you?</h2>
          I enjoyed the Fogg idea but I think timeboxing is a key aspect to rotating through problems so that a fresh line of problem solving an be brought to the task. I think mixing the Fogg technique with an adapted Pomodoro approach would be best for me.
      </p>
      <P>
        <h2> which will you experiment further with? </h2>
          I will keep mixing it up when I feel I am getting stuck on something. This shoudl keep it interesting :) and keep me learning and engaged with the process.
