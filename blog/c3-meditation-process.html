          <p><h2>What did I think about meditation before chapter 2</h2>
            Mediation has come up multiple times so far in my life. However I can say I am not a regular practicer. I go through short intervals every few years when I am consciously choose to meditate. It's an interesting thought that even though I know it is meant to help me I in it a bit wishy washy and hard to commit to despite having been brought up around it.
            I suppose this in part could be due to me never having sought out the information and rather it being so presetn kind of put me off integrating it into my life.
