    <h1> Self Mastery </h1>
    <i>One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself.<br>
—Leonardo da Vinci</i>
<br><br>
<i>From Compulsion to Choice</i>
<br>
    <h2>Daniel Golemans Five Emotional Competencies</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Self-control: Keeping disruptive emotions and impulses in check</li>
      <li>Trustworthiness: Maintaining standards of honesty and integrity</li>
      <li>Conscientiousness: Taking responsibility for personal performance </li>
      <li>Adaptability: Flexibility in handling change</li>
      <li>Innovation: Being comfortable with novel ideas, approaches, and information</li>
 </ol>
 <p>
   <H2> Four General Principles for Dealing with Distressing Emotions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Know when you are not in pain.
    <li>Do not feel bad about feeling bad.</li>
    <li>Do not feed the monsters.</li>
    <li>Start every thought with kindness and humor.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
 <p>while we cannot stop an unwholesome thought or emotion from arising, we have the power to let it go, and the highly trained mind can let it go the moment it arises.<br> - Dalai Lama.
   <br><br>
   Grasping is when the mind desperately holds on to something and refuses to let it go.
   Aversion is when the mind desperately keeps something away and refuses to let it come.
   Grasping and aversion together account for a huge percentage of the suffering we experience, perhaps 90 percent, maybe even 100 percent.
   <br><br>
   If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment. <br>- Marcus Aurelius
   <br><br>
   Not feeding monsters is very good economics.<br> -Tan, Chade-Meng

<h3>Identifying Emotional Trigger Responses:</h3>
Executive coach Marc Lesser provided these helpful suggestions on things to look out for:
<ul>
  <li>Body: Shallow breathing, rapid heartbeat, and sick to the stomach</li>
  <li>Emotions: Experiencing a flight-or-flight response, either feeling like a “deer in headlights” or having an emotional outburst (what Goleman famously calls an “amygdala hijack”)</li>
  <li>Thoughts: Feeling like a victim, thoughts of blame and judgment, difficulty paying attention</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <h3>
      My Triggers when programming:
    </h3>
    feeling blocked, or unable to figure out a solution -> feel stupid
