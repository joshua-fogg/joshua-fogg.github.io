    <h2>Daniel Golemans Five Emotional Competencies</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Self-control: Keeping disruptive emotions and impulses in check</li>
      <li>Trustworthiness: Maintaining standards of honesty and integrity</li>
      <li>Conscientiousness: Taking responsibility for personal performance </li>
      <li>Adaptability: Flexibility in handling change</li>
      <li>Innovation: Being comfortable with novel ideas, approaches, and information</li>
 </ol>
 <p>
   <H2> Four General Principles for Dealing with Distressing Emotions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Know when you are not in pain.
    <li>Do not feel bad about feeling bad.</li>
    <li>Do not feed the monsters.</li>
    <li>Start every thought with kindness and humor.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
 <p>while we cannot stop an unwholesome thought or emotion from arising, we have the power to let it go, and the highly trained mind can let it go the moment it arises.<br> - Dalai Lama.
   <br><br>
   Grasping is when the mind desperately holds on to something and refuses to let it go.
   Aversion is when the mind desperately keeps something away and refuses to let it come.
   Grasping and aversion together account for a huge percentage of the suffering we experience, perhaps 90 percent, maybe even 100 percent.
   <br><br>
   If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment. <br>- Marcus Aurelius
   <br><br>
   Not feeding monsters is very good economics.<br> -Tan, Chade-Meng

      What are Triggers and What Triggers Me:

    <h3>Identifying Emotional Trigger Responses:</h3>
    Executive coach Marc Lesser provided these helpful suggestions on things to look out for:
    <ul>
      <li>Body: Shallow breathing, rapid heartbeat, and sick to the stomach</li>
      <li>Emotions: Experiencing a flight-or-flight response, either feeling like a “deer in headlights” or having an emotional outburst (what Goleman famously calls an “amygdala hijack”)</li>
      <li>Thoughts: Feeling like a victim, thoughts of blame and judgment, difficulty paying attention</li>
    </ul>
    feeling blocked, or unable to figure out a solution -> feel stupid
  </p>

   <h2> Siberian North Railroad Exercise </h2> <!--content of this section adapted from Search Inside Yourself, 2012, Tan, Chade-Meng -->
  <p>
    <h3> What is the Siberian North Railroad Exercise </h3>
      Triggers almost always have long histories behind them. When we get triggered, it is very often because it brings back something from the past, that here-we-go-again feeling.
      Triggers are also very often connected to a perceived flaw or lacking quality about ourselves, that is a source of pain to us. For example, if my state of mind hold an insecurity about my performance at work, a mere suggestion from my boss that he/she is slightly concerned about my project’s progress may cause a trigger reaction in me. Contrastingly, if my state of mind is confident about my work, my reaction to my boss will be entirely different.
    <br><br>
      Thus enters the 'Siberian North Railroad.'
    <br>
      Here is a practice called the <strong>Siberian North Railroad</strong> for dealing with triggers. It is a useful practice not only for triggers but also for other situations in which we need to deal with negative or distressing emotions.
    <br>
      <h2>The Siberian North Railroad</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stop:</strong> When you feel triggered, stop and take a moment. This is called the <strong> Sacred Pause.</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>Breathe:</strong> Take a breath deep into your belly to help you remain calm and give a clarity of thinking. Thi induces the vagus nerve, causing a slower heart rate and decreased blood pressure.
</li>
<li><strong>Notice:</strong> Bring attention to how the feeling affects your body.
</li>
<li><strong>Reflect:</strong> What caused this trigger? Do we know of any history around this trigger? Was I triggered by feeling inadequate? Look at the situation from the other persons position and try to understand their actions, this will help to bring respective.
</li>
<li><strong> Respond:</strong>Think about ways in which you can respond to the situation that is the most kind and positive. This helps to keep the listener engaged and prevents them from shuting off and becomming defensive as they can with an aggressive response.
</li>
</ol>
    <h3> Me & the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond):
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What was the event?<br>
        The other night my partner returned from her day of equestrian sports and landscaping. While I was preparing dinner she became re-accuringly agitated towards me. I thought it was just a current annoyance and perhaps I was just reading too much into it, so I quitened down and went about making dinner and she went off downstairs to do some tidying. After reflecting on her behaviours and mannerisms I concluded she was tire and annoyed that I had not done what she would have done if she had been around home all day. I made her a cup of tea and took it down to her to tell her to sit down and put her feet up. We had a small discussion and then she seemed to lift with the thought of the tea.
      </li>

      <li>What were the feelings that arose?<br>
        My initial feelings were of anger and dismayed. I felt like she was tired and just wanted to have a nag over something. Being aware of my state and knowin of he state I could see two options, escalate the situation and get into a steam blow or diffuse the situation by letting her dissipitate and wait until she would be open to softening.</li>

      <li>Where in your body did you feel it / do you feel it now?<br>
        I felt it in my shoulder blades and neck. I could feel the tension winding up in frustraition with her. The defense mechanism charging it's batteries. By choosing not to engage I could step back, analyse the situation and figure out a way to be constructive towards my partner.</li>
