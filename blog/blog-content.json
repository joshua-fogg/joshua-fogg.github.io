It was interesting reading about the articles that covered the impact of mindfulness meditation on physiologyical outcomes, i.e. psoriasis healing time / prevalence and attention-blink frequencies."

It also gives a greater endorphine return as exercise is being incorporated into the practice.... plus I can tend to have a few too many coffees so this helps walk it off..."
