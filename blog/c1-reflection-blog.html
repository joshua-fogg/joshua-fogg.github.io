        <p>What's my take on the EDA experience? </P>

      I think that the EDA experience causes you to own up to your mistakes and step out from unde your shell.
      It seems the majority of learning is directed to help force you to enable yourself, to motivate yourself and be the change you want to see.

      <p> My impressions of EDA so far are somewhat limited, however the previous students and employers I have met that know of EDA speak highly and passionately about the course and it's graduates. <p/>
        <p> I'm looking forward to testing the waters in this culture to see what I and my team can create. </p>
        <p> I will admit I am nervous of the uncertainties but I look forward to the adventure and meeting some new comrades. </P>

          <H1> Reflections from Shereed Kitchen on Kitchen vs Table </h1>
          <p> <li> Kitchen mindset: what can I create. I have the ability to do and create.
          <li> Table mindset: What will I consume / order. Low outcome long term.
            <li> being able to help and co-construct will give us the greatest creativity and development.
