  <H1> Reflections from Shereed Kitchen on Kitchen vs Table </h1>
<p> <li> Kitchen mindset: what can I create. I have the ability to do and create.
  <li> Table mindset: What will I consume / order. Low outcome long term.
    <li> being able to help and co-construct will give us the greatest creativity and development.

      <p>What's my take on the EDA experience? </P>

        <--!I think that the EDA experience causes you to own up to your mistakes and step out from unde your shell.
        It seems the majority of learning is directed to force you to enable yourself, to motivate yourself and be the change you want to see. --!>

      <p> What are your impressions? <p/>
      <p> How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture? </p>
      <P> Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how? </p>
      <p> Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </p>
