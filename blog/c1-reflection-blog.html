        <h2> <p>What's my take on the EDA experience? </P></h2>
    <p>I think that the EDA experience causes you to own up to your mistakes and step out from unde your shell.
      It seems the majority of learning is directed to help force you to enable yourself, to motivate yourself and be the change you want to see. </P>

<h2>What are your impressions?</H2>

        <p> My impressions of EDA so far have been based on previous EDA students I have met. They all spoke very highly and passionately about the course and it's graduates.<p/>

<h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</H2>
        <p> I'm looking forward to meeting my cohort and developing a culture of our own. </p>

<p><h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</H2>
My exectations haven't changed since enrolling, the experience so far has been how I thought it would be.

        <p><h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</H2>
         I will admit I am nervous of the uncertainties but I look forward to crafting new skillsets, taking an adventure and meeting some new comrades. </P>

          <H1> Reflections from Shereed Kitchen on Kitchen vs Table </h1>
          <p> <li> Kitchen mindset: what can I create. I have the ability to do and create.
          <li> Table mindset: What will I consume / order. Low outcome long term.
            <li> being able to help and co-construct will give us the greatest creativity and development.
