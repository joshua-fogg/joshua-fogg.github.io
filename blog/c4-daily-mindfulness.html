Mindfull Conversations:
Natural: Informal practice; adopt a generous attitude by gifting the speaker your attention.
Artificial: Formal Practice; construct conversations to train the 3 skills for mindful listening. At the end it allows discussion of the talk.
</p>
<p>
Mindfullness Techniques:
1. mindful listening: Allows frienships to be established in 6 minutes.
2. looping: Collaborative project where 2 or more people work together to help the listeners fully understand the speaker.
3. Dippig: Self-awareness during listening.

  Chapter 3:
   <h2>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? </h2>

**understand what emotional intelligence is and how its developed
**understand the benefits of emotional intelligence
**understand techniques and practices for improving emotional intelligence
**have developed simple mindfulness practice

   <h2>How did the other person find it?</h2>
   <h2>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h2>
	<p>
	I think keeping my practice enjoyable will be a big key in trying to sustain this practice for me. From my understanding if something is easy or enjoyable we are less likely to push it to the side when our motivation dips. I think this will be a great tool to ensuring I keep thinking of the practice as a positive rather than a chore, and in doing so it will help keep em conscious of the practice and reinforce a routine.
<br>
	At the moment I am working closely with Ali on the Enspiral site. I think I will see if he will be a buddy for the one breath a day. In doing so I should be covering all angles. :)

   <h2>Any other musings?</h2>

<br>
<ul>
<li>Mindful Conversation is most useful when communication is at an impasse, i.e conflict. </li>
<li> three parts to this skill are listening, looping, and dipping. </li>
<li> Questions to utilise at a regualr interval with a mindfulness buddy:
	<ul>
	<li>How am I doing with my commitment to my practice? </li>
	<li> What has arisen in my life that relates to my practice?</li>
	<li> how did this conversation go? </li>
	</ul>
<li> Do less than you can: keep it enjoyable and easy </li>
<li> Take one breath a day: start with small easily achievable goals to build and reinforce a routine. </li>
<li> Somtimes not trying hard can give the greatest yeild </li>
<li> The better you are at letting go, the better you are at both meditating and falling asleep. </li>
<li> Have expectations before meditation, but have no expectation during meditation. </li>
<li> Sukha is a quality of joy not requiring energy. it is so subtle that it takes a very quiet mind to access </li>
<li> Meditation Circuit Training </li>
<li>meditation progress</li>
<ul>
	<li>Initial Access Phase: (Gradual Effort phase) able to access a certain state of mind but it is easily lost.</li>
	<li>Lag Phase: not much changes despite effort </li>
	<li>Consolidation Phase: (Sudden Enlightenment phase) boom pahse where on demand state of mind state. often follows a long lag phase</li>
