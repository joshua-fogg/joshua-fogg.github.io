1. coding -. direct manipulation of data.
ideas that require people unlearn what they learn and to try to think in new ways
often a lot of resistance  - Bret Victor, 2013

visual or physical data manipulation. started 1962, only taking off today.

2. procedures: goals and constraints.
use goals and restraints.

Planner 1969- can logically express foreward and backwards.
Prolog 1972 - leads to logic programming.
Snobol 1962 -  pattern matching on text.
Unix -
ARPANET -
 How to communicate between sapient beings.

express programme as what you want it to do rather than how to do it.
- goal directed.

3. Text Dump: spatial representation.
Grail 1968 - flow charts: recognises hand drawn boxes and handwriting and turns it into printed product.
SmallTalk browser -

user interface is responsive, intereactive computing.

4. Sequentual Programming:
- Von Neumann Bottleneck: cpu->Memory. One memory to one processor. Single core processors. Has a lot of redundant memory not being used.
  -> integrated circuit -> 4004 Microprocessor Intel 1971. Massively Parrallel Processor Array. Maximises processor time and memory use. -> future architecture.

  Programming today = threads and locks. --not scalable.
  - dead end

  Actor Model 1973 - physics inspired.

Break out of Dogma! - great ideas in the 60's-70's: early enough that programming wasnt defined. Try everything.
Once you think you know what you are doing you stop looking around and thinking.
