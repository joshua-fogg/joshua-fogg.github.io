    <li> <h2> Grid Based Design: </h2> </li> <br>
      <p> Grid based design is a design process, where a web pages is broken down into boxes that stack into rows and columns. These boxes can then be filled with page content. The grid design process allows for a clarity in designing and <b>creating a 2-D website.</b> Typically a 12-column grid is used as it allows the page to be broken into 2, 3, 4 and 6 sections easily. </p>

    <li><h2> Responsive Webpages, what's the deal: </h2> </li><br>
    Responsive web pages are designed to maintain a consistant user experience across multiple resolutions. This means a website with responsive webpages will adjust to the users screen size helping the user to have continued ease of use across multiple resolutions.

  <li> <h2> Semantic Structure: </h2></li> <br>
    Semantic code..... create elements, elements and formats specific to the use, allows clearer structure, easier design. 


    **Semantic code is code written in a way so your computer can understand what you are asking. It also follows a specific structure, such as: h1, h2, h3, h4 and so on.
**Semantic structure in the web is the way in which we go about and structure our documents with the appropriate tags. Traditionally in HTML this was done with Class (class) or an Identity (id) tag to describe what an element is used for. Now HTML 5 is now using different element types that better define what it can be used for, an example of this can be shown by replacing <div id=”nav”> with <nav>.
