    <h2>Life Through A 'Pleasure, Passion and Purpose' Lens?</h2>
Chapter five introduces the pillars of happiness concept. Stating that happiness can be found in three forms, each of a varying sustainability.
<br>
    <h3>The Three Pillars of Happiness:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pleasure:<br>
        This type of happiness requires chasing the next high to sustain the elation.
        <br>
        This type of happiness is considered short lived and invoked by a stimulus, which once removed causes the happiness to dissipate. <br>
        Typically this seems to become the first point of call for most unhappy people, using it as a first point of call like with chocolate or commercial therapy for a pick me up or getting a bonus at work. It can be thought of as a consumable as it requires the  most resource expenditure to sustain.
      </li>
      <li>Passion:<br>
        Passion can also be known “flow,” where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by.
        <br>
        This is also known by yet another name more commonly so in athletic circles as "being in the zone."
        <br>
        Sustaining this state of happiness is much more sustainable than pleasure, however it is harder to habituate it. This can be likened to a state of focus, where answers to obstacles can be more easily visualised and actuated.
        <br>
    <li>Higher Purpose:<br>
      This is often refered to being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you.
      Higher purpose has the highest sustainability as it facilitates altruistic sources, allows you to find a deep meaning and fulfillment in your life. Typically an altruistic based purpose or even shade tends to drive positive reinforcement from those around you. These aspects make this origin of happiness the most sustainable and resilient.
      This is considered where time and effort should be spent day to day. It is also highly dynamic and can vary greatly form person to person.</li>
      <br><br>
    </ol>

      Taking this information into account the 'Three Pillars' reminds me more of a food pyramid, I must have been hungry when I read the chapter. Translating the Three Pillars into a pyramid you would want a resistant and long lasting foundation such as a Higher Purpose to nestle the remaining building blocks of Happiness on. The next tier would be a tier of Passion, before finally a comparatively brief amount of Passion.
      <br><br>
      I retrospect of reading the fifth chapter I can see how easily we try to use pleasure to compensate or evade a lack of higher purpose or passion in our day to day lives.
  </p>

    <h2>Core Values & Personal Standing:</h2>
    From the 'discover values and higher purpose' exercise we are meant to be able to gain insight into what drives us, what will motivate and reward us. To some extend I feel some of the answers that came up coudl have been due to educational conditioning but there are definately some that I felt a resonation with. They are below.
</p>
<p>
    <h3>What are your core values?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>To be accepting and open minded around different backgrounds, religions and cultures.</strong><br>Over  the years I have come across a varriety of people and backgrounds and I find that I have something to learn from  every encounter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Compassion </strong><br>Cheesy I know but it makes my cut. The truth is we seldomly know what the full   deal in someone elses life is, yet we react most often before we have a clue. Regardless of their position or   status we are all living day by day just trying to be happy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Curiosity & Boldness</strong><br>Take those first steps and explore.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Community</strong><br>The people around you made you what you are today.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Happiness / Optimism</strong><br>we all just want to be happy and often being curious and bold while working with  your community will achieve this. If we don't want to get out of bed how can we do anything with our day.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wisdom</strong><br>Intelligence and Beauty are overated. Wisdom requires knowledge, experience and  judgement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Colaboration -> Mutualism </strong><br>Rome wasn't built in a day but a large community put in the  effort and it still stands today.
      </li>
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>What Do I Stand For?</h3>
    Buses, coffee and the elderly mainly ;)<br>
    My standings are for future planning to develop a sustainable and mindful culture, using technologies and human interactions creatively and fairly to develop our environment and life around us.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h2>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h2>
I liked the reminder that success and failure are emotional experiences which can twist our view or logic if not recognised, ultimately holding us back or reduce our abilities to achieve our goals. I found teh meditation exercise to be a good experience, being able to learn and recognise the physiological reactions of failure and success and become aware of them.
<br><br>
The layout of the meditation was useful also, whereby you plung into the depressing feelings before expanding into the more pleasuring sensation of success and then pulling away to guide yourself back to being in a state of calm. An efficient rollercoaster.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h2>Additionals From Chapter Five</h2>
    <br>
      Traditional monetary incentives work well for routine, rule-based work: jobs that do not require a lot of creativity. Work that requires creativity or other cognitive skills, monetary incentives do not work well; they can even be counterproductive. BUT intrinsic ones do: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.

  <h3>Motivation Practices:</h3>

  <ol>
    <li> Alignment: Aligning our work with our values and higher purpose:<br>
      A. The work is deeply meaningful to you.<br>
      B. It generates a state of flow in you.<br>
    </li>

    <li>
      Envisioning: Seeing the desired future for ourselves.<br>
      Discovering Values and higher purpsoe. Envisioning is based on a very simple idea,<br>
      it’s much easier to achieve something if you can visualize yourself already achieving it.
  </li>

    <li>Resilience: Resilience is the ability to overcome obstacles along the way.<br>
    Alignment and envisioning help you find out where you want to go, and resilience helps you get there.<br>
      A. Inner calm: Once we can consistently access the inner calm in the mind, it becomes the foundation of alloptimism and resilience.<br>
      B. Emotional resilience: Success and failure are emotional experiences. By working at this level, we canincrease our capacity for them.<br>
      C. Cognitive resilience: Understanding how we explain our setbacks to ourselves and creating useful mentalhabits help us develop optimism.<br>
      </li>
      <br><br>
        OR
      <br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>Autonomy: The urge to direct our own lives</li>
      <li>Mastery: The desire to get better and better at something that matters</li>
      <li>Purpose: The yearning to do what we do in service of something larger than ourselves3</li>
    </ol>
    <br><br>
    3:1 ratio: In general, each negative feeling is three times as powerful as a positive one.
    <br><br>
    The first step to learning optimism is becoming aware of our own strong negative experiential bias.<br>
    The second step is mindfulness. Learning optimism requires us to create objectivity toward our own experiences<br> and, as mentioned in Chapter 4, mindfulness is the best way to create that objectivity.<br>
    The final step is transformation. When experiencing success, take conscious note of it and accept credit for it.<br> This creates a mental habit of paying due attention to your successes. When experiencing failure, focus<br> on realistic evidence suggesting that this setback may be temporary.
