    <h1> Motivation </h1>
  <p>
    The three pillars of happiness:
    1. Pleasure: This type of happiness is about always chasing the next high.
    It is the rock-star type of happiness because it is very hard to maintain unless you are living the lifestyle of a rock star.
    - short lived.
    - stimulus invoked.
    - first point of call. ie consumables most resource expenditure needed to sustain.
    - should be thouhgt of as icing on the cake.

    2. Passion: Also known as “flow,” where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by.
    - much more sustainable.
    - far lesslikely to habituate it.
    - in the zone.
    - Flow is a state of focused attention,.


    3. Higher Purpose: This is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you.
    - high sustainability.
    - altruistic origin most long lasting.
    - resilient.
    - where we should be spending our time and effort.
    - should eb the day to day.

    *traditional monetary incentives work well for routine, rule-based work: jobs that do not require a lot of creativity.
    *work that requires creativity or other cognitive skills, monetary incentives do not work well; they can even be counterproductive. BUT intrinsic ones do: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.


<h1>three practices for motivation:</h1>

    1. Alignment: Aligning our work with our values and higher purpose
      A. The work is deeply meaningful to you
      B. It generates a state of flow in you

    2. Envisioning: Seeing the desired future for ourselves.
    Discovering Values and higher purpsoe.Envisioning is based on a very simple idea:
    it’s much easier to achieve something if you can visualize yourself already achieving it.

    3. Resilience: Resilience is the ability to overcome obstacles along the way.
    Alignment and envisioning help you find out where you want to go, and resilience helps you get there.
      1. Inner calm: Once we can consistently access the inner calm in the mind, it becomes the foundation of all optimism and resilience.

      2. Emotional resilience: Success and failure are emotional experiences. By working at this level, we can increase our capacity for them.

      3. Cognitive resilience: Understanding how we explain our setbacks to ourselves and creating useful mental habits help us develop optimism.

    OR

    1. Autonomy: The urge to direct our own lives

    2. Mastery: The desire to get better and better at something that matters

    3. Purpose: The yearning to do what we do in service of something larger than ourselves3
