<h1>Self Awareness Competencies</h1>
Emotional Competence: “a learned capability based on emotional intelligence that results in outstanding performance at work" - Daniel Goldman.
<p>
Emotional awareness: Recognizing your emotions and their effects on your behaviour. Ability to view yourself from someone elses perspective.

<li>Emotional awareness may even have a direct impact on the bottom line. For example, organizational psychologists Dr. Cary Cherniss and Dr. Robert Caplan reported that teaching emotional awareness skills to financial advisors at American Express Financial Advisors resulted in more revenue per advisor.</li>
<li>On 360-degree competence assessments, average performers typically overestimate their strengths, whereas star performers rarely do</li>


Self-confidence isn’t egotism.... When you are truly self-confident, you are flexible with regard to ego: you can pick up ego when necessary, but you can also put it down when necessary in order to learn something completely new through listening. And if you find that you can’t put ego down, at least you know that this is so. You can admit it to yourself. If takes profound self-confidence to be humble enough to recognize your own limitations without self-blame.5

 <br>
Accurate self-assessment: Knowing one’s strengths and limits.
Honest about strengths and weaknesses. clear priorities. comfortable with self.
It asks questions like: What are my strengths and weaknesses? What are my resources and limitations? What matters to me? Accurate self-assessment builds on emotional awareness.
<br>
Self-confidence: A strong sense of one’s self-worth and capabilities. high correlation with work performance, more so than goal setting. Comes from deep self-knowledge and blatant self-honesty.

attention is what drives neurological change

  <h2>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h2>
   <h2>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h2>
