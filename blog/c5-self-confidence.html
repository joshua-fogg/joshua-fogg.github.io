<h1>Self Awareness and Confidence</h1>
    Emotional Competence: “a learned capability based on emotional intelligence that results in outstanding performance at work" - Daniel Goldman.
  <p>
    Emotional awareness: Recognizing your emotions and their effects on your behaviour. Ability to view yourself from someone elses perspective.

  <li>
    Emotional awareness may even have a direct impact on the bottom line. For example, organizational psychologists Dr. Cary Cherniss and Dr. Robert Caplan reported that teaching emotional awareness skills to financial advisors at American Express Financial Advisors resulted in more revenue per advisor.
  </li>
  <li>
    On 360-degree competence assessments, average performers typically overestimate their strengths, whereas star performers rarely do
  </li>


Self-confidence isn’t egotism.... When you are truly self-confident, you are flexible with regard to ego: you can pick up ego when necessary, but you can also put it down when necessary in order to learn something completely new through listening. And if you find that you can’t put ego down, at least you know that this is so. You can admit it to yourself. If takes profound self-confidence to be humble enough to recognize your own limitations without self-blame.5
</p>



 <br>
  Accurate self-assessment: Knowing one’s strengths and limits.
  Honest about strengths and weaknesses. clear priorities. comfortable with self.
  It asks questions like: What are my strengths and weaknesses? What are my resources and limitations? What matters to me? Accurate self-assessment builds on emotional awareness.
<br>
  Self-confidence: A strong sense of one’s self-worth and capabilities. high correlation with work performance, more so than goal setting. Comes from deep self-knowledge and blatant self-honesty.

  attention is what drives neurological change
<p>
  With enough mindfulness practice, you may eventually notice a subtle but important shift—you may begin to feel that emotions are simply what you feel, not who you are. Emotions go from being existential (“I am”) to experiential (“I feel”). suggests the possibility of mastery over our emotions.

<h2>Mindfulness and Self-Awareness?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Mindfulness</strong> is a process of the psyche where by you pay attention in the present moment, non-judgmentally. This is akin to the flagpole in Chade-Meng's analogy from <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12921211-search-inside-yourself"> Search Inside Yourself</a> below.
<br>
  <strong>Self-awareness</strong> is a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions. This is akin to the flag in the below example.
<br>
  <strong>Both are trainable.</strong>
  <br>

  Tan, Chade-Meng(2012):
  <br>
  "The traditional analogy of this mind is a fluttering flag on a flagpole. The flag represents the mind. In the presence of strong emotions, the mind may be turbulent like a flag fluttering violently in the wind."

   <h2>
     Self awareness practices from chapter 4 (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?
   </h2>
  <p>
    Body scan – Can be done during meditation and requires no additional tools. It is where you systemically bring full attention to different parts of the body starting from the top of your body and gradually sweep down the other end of your body. It is ideal to finish with thinking about a positive emotion.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Journaling – requires tools to record your thoughts on paper. It's likened to uncorking your brain and allowing your thoughts to flow onto the paper infront of you. This method often helps identify emotional themes and allows clarify ideas on paper. It is important to start with a prompt, which can start a theme of thought. Prompts can include:
    <ul>
      <li>What I am feeling now is… </li>
      <li>I am aware that…</li>
      <li>What motivates me is…</li>
    </ul>
    When I have done this in the past I have often felt like a load has been taken off by the end of it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I can see how both of these methods and practices are beneficial and rewarding. I do admit I find these hard to sit down and commit to, I feel a bit silly doing so unless there is something big getting to me. I have found in the past these methods rewarding, typically if I am in a private space then I will do <strong>journalling</strong> as I can write things on paper and get rid of them at the end. I have found the <strong>Body-Scan</strong> useful with martial arts and sports as it helps me to feel out and be aware off any injuries I have developed during practice. I find this method most useful for reminding myself to go do something physical or stretching as I become aware of lethargy or stiffness in me from sitting on a computer.

     Take Aways From "My Emotions are Not Me":
   </h2>
<p>
  I think Mingyur Rinpoche's metaphor, "the moment you can see a raging river, it means you are already rising above it", is a great way to look at the usefulness of mindfulness. Being able to identify and process emotions rather than reacting due to emotions allows for better communcation of issues and allows for better collaboration and development of suitable outcomes.
  Being able to control the mind and not allowing things to be turned into huge disasters leads to a clear, open platform for commnication and resolution.
