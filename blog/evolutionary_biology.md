mutation rate one chromosome = neuron convection rate.
-- mutation level changes based on selectiv pressures on each loci


-- applying trial and error net of best fit to situation.
-- multiple runs. --> 'algorithm should be free to decide'

algorithm parameters == key, changes scope of the scale of ability.

-- unlimited chromosome lense vs 4x, 12x

computer testing -> each component or equipment = an island, population migrationa dn emigration of resources across genrations to find optimal density.
