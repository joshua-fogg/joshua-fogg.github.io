<h2> Javascript vs HTML and CSS:</h2>
<p> HTML and CSS are static forms of code, this means they dont have animated sections or lack interaction between users and the site. Java script on the other hand allows interactive and dynamic interactions and features within websites. Javascript allows loops to be created, data to be sotred and accessed, and compute algebra. While Javascript has many benefits, it can feel like HTML and CSS's uptight cousin who likes to throw in the towel if your diction or syntax are even slightly off.</p>

<p> * HTML gives a structure  <br> *   CSS allows for style and design   <br> *Javascript allows programmers to create unique and interactive experiences

<h2>Control Flow and Loops: </h2>
<p>
  Control Flow is an important concept  to be mindful of as it is the order in which the computer proceeds to execute statements.

  Example: Imagine before you went to bed each night, you wrote a list of things to do the next day after you wake up. This list included activities like brushing your teeth, getting dressed, having breakfast and heading to work.
  Now if you were to write these in a radom order you may get dressed once you have left the house and are at work in fornt of your work colleagues. However if you were to prioritise these activities then you could ensure you don't rock up to work without breakfast and naked.
<br>
    Control Flow can be thought of in this manner. It causes priorities for computers to process the instructions.
</p>
<p>
  Loops are a type of code that will repeat until interrrupted or told to stop. Loops reduce the amount of coding required to do repeatable functions. Loops allow a more refined and compact level of code to repeat coding blocks.

<h2>Data Accessing from Arrays and Objects:</h2>
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Objects: data is stored in a key to value pair. </li>
<br>
            <li>Pulling data from an object requires the object property name to call the calue of the property.</li>
  <li> Arrays: data is stored in a predefined order and stores only the appropriate value.</li>
  </ul>
<br>

</p>
<br>
<p>
<h2>Functions:</h2>
Functions are a type of coding structure that allow for variables and values to be taken in, computed, calculated, altered and returned to the user or input.
