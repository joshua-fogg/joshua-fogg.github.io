<h2> Javascript vs HTML and CSS:</h2>
<p> If we were to compare HTML and CSS  to Javascript using a motorbike as an example. HTML and CSS would be the bikes overall look and style and build. Javascript however would be the light switches, electronics, steering and gear system,. These are all points where the user can interact with the bike and generate a change in behaviour from the bike. Javascript druves interaction and changes in behaviour, allowing a rich interaction with the user.
</p>
<p>
  So within website Javascript allows the creation of loops and functions, data capabilities and a more refined user experience.
  Although Javascript has these benefits, it requires a more demanding and variable syntax than HTML and CSS, as it must differntiate between a wider variety of instructions in its script. It is for this rea reason that Javascript can feel like HTML and CSS's uptight friend who likes to throw in the towel if your diction or syntax are even slightly off.
</p>

<p> * HTML gives a structure  <br> *   CSS allows for style and design   <br> *Javascript allows programmers to create unique and interactive experiences

<h2>Control Flow and Loops: </h2>
<p>
  Control Flow is an important concept  to be mindful of as it is the order in which the computer proceeds to execute statements.

  Example: Imagine before you went to bed each night, you wrote a list of things to do the next day after you wake up. This list included activities like brushing your teeth, getting dressed, having breakfast and heading to work.
  Now if you were to write these in a radom order you may get dressed once you have left the house and are at work in fornt of your work colleagues. However if you were to prioritise these activities then you could ensure you don't rock up to work without breakfast and naked.
<br>
    Control Flow can be thought of in this manner. It causes priorities for computers to process the instructions.
</p>
<p>
  Loops are a type of code that will repeat until interrrupted or told to stop. Loops reduce the amount of coding required to do repeatable functions. Loops allow a more refined and compact level of code to repeat coding blocks.

<h2>Data Accessing from Arrays and Objects:</h2>
<p>You access data from arrays using the array index (numbers starting from zero that are associated with each item in the array). Objects have Key:value pairs, meaning object properties can be accessed by using their property name or key.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, object data can be accessed using dot notation and bracket notation. Arrays rely solely on bracket notation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h2>Functions:</h2>
Functions are a type of coding structure that allow for variables and values to be taken in, computed, calculated, altered and returned to the user or input. The input and logical method are stored within a block of code. </p>
<p> Functions are great for repeating steps.
