<h2>Emotional Intelligence:</h2>
Search Inside yourself, 2014; Chade-Meng Tan, That Google Guy. Chapter 1.

The first chapter's teachings.
The first chapter reminded me of many elements and teachings I had been exposed to while growing up. Meng introduces the reader to the idea of self awareness and self-regulation, using the term "Emotional Intelligence" to describe them.

<h3>What is emotional intelligence</h3>
Emotional Intelligence is the capacity to which we are able to be aware of, control, and express our emotions. It allows us to be mindful of our emotional state and to allow us to have more control over our emotions and reactions.
Emotional intelligence allows us to navigate interpersonal relationships in a rational state and allows us to more effectively communicate with our work team, family and extended social circles.
