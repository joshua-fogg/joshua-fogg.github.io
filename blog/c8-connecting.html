      <h2>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h2>
    In previous roles I have seen and experienced how the loss of sincerity and trust within a group especially with a groups elader can degrade and ultimately break down a group. While I find the teachings to bring back words of wisdom from my parents I find myself thinking that at the moment I am not in a role where I use this. I look forward to using the refurbished toolkit to work with my cohort memebrs and teamates in the near future to recieve feedback onmyself and to help others progress and develop.
    <br><br>
    I do think this method would be useful in industry sectors like construction and landscaping, where typical the culture is of mistrust and covering your ass so you aren't yelled at or belittled.</p>

     <p>
       <h2>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h2>
       Empathetic listening can hold many benefits, especially for navigating difficult situations, allowing each party to feel listened to and be able to spend energy on progressing the conversation rather than putting up defensive walls. I have been exposed to similar lines of thought to help convey and educate those in denial around environmental issues and global warming.

       <h2>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h2>
        This ook me bak to being at the monastry as a kid. I have seen the effects of this exercise and how useful it can be to reduce stress and break down limiting walls between people. It is a method I try to use to keep looking from outside the box and better understand people I am having trouble with.

       <h2>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h2>
       I was invited to a meeting between the GM and ground level staff from each department. I was told that day that I would be attending. I was told that it was a channel for the GM to get direct feedback from the ground level of each department in a semi-informal manner. When asked for my take on my department I replied that I enjoyed working where I was, I expressed the priviledges I felt my co-workers and I shared. I also gave forth my view on where our department needed assistance. We had experienced some very dangerous situations over the past month due to our operational budget being drasticaly restricted. I viewed my opinion on where we could increase the customer experience also.<br>
       The following day I was asked why I had shared such information and told that it was incorrect adn that we may be sacked as a result.
       <br><br>
       From my View being 100% correct: I had attempted to bring awareness to higher management about concerns that could have cost us direly if were not maintained as per our guidelines and laws because they were after a better return to present to stakeholders. My manager failed to ever give me or my team an indication of how the department was operating, or any knowledge about external challenges we/they were facing. I was blamed for bringing to light the consequences of the financial managers cutting corners and the lengths we had to go through to keep the operation going.
       <br><br>
       From Manager being 100% correct: Why did the he not ask me for a background or financial standing before attending the meeting. The issues were solved privately within our department and did not need to be aired with anybody else. He made me look poorly infront of the GM for issues that were avoided. We do not want to be under the spotlight. I now have to make an argument why not to shutdown our department and contract it out.

       <i>Being praised for being smart is bad for you.</i> -Tan Chade-Meng.<br>
       Specifically, there are four things we can do to strengthen our ability for empathic listening.
       <ol>
         <li>Mindfulness: With mindfulness, we become more perceptive and receptive.</li>
         <li>Kindness: When we are kind, we can listen better to feelings.</li>
         <li>Curiosity: Practice wondering what someone might be feeling when you hear their stories.</li>
         <li>Practice: Just do a lot of empathic listening. The more you do it, the better you become, especially when you practice it in conjunction with  mindfulness, kindness, and curiosity.</li>
       </ol>
