<h2> Javascript vs HTML and CSS:</h2>
<p> If we were to compare HTML and CSS  to Javascript using a motorbike as an example. HTML and CSS would be the bikes overall look and style and build. Javascript however would be the light switches, electronics, steering and gear system,. These are all points where the user can interact with the bike and generate a change in behaviour from the bike. Javascript druves interaction and changes in behaviour, allowing a rich interaction with the user.
</p>
<p>
  So within website Javascript allows the creation of loops and functions, data capabilities and a more refined user experience.
  Although Javascript has these benefits, it requires a more demanding and variable syntax than HTML and CSS, as it must differntiate between a wider variety of instructions in its script. It is for this rea reason that Javascript can feel like HTML and CSS's uptight friend who likes to throw in the towel if your diction or syntax are even slightly off.
</p>

<p> * HTML gives a structure  <br> *   CSS allows for style and design   <br> *Javascript allows programmers to create unique and interactive experiences

<h2>Control Flow and Loops: </h2>
<p>
  Control Flow is an important concept in computer science, it is the order in which individual statements, instructions or functions are looked at and executed.
  <br><br>
Imagine that before you went to bed each night, you wrote a list of things to do the next day after you wake up. This list included activities like brushing your teeth, getting dressed, having breakfast and heading to work.
<br><br>
  Now if you were to write these in a radom order you may end up dressing once you have left the house. However if you were to prioritise these activities then you could ensure you don't rock up to work without first being ready for the day.
<br><br>
  This prioritisation is '' Control Flow", it causes priorities and order for computers that are working through a script of instructions.
</p>
<p>
  Loops are a type of code that will repeat until interrrupted or told to stop. Loops are great for  reducing the amount of coding required to do the same steps. Loops give an efficient way to reduce the amount of code needed to repeat certain steps.
  <br><br>
  For instance in the previous example a coding loop would be the equivalent of writing out a list once and knowing to re-follow the same list each day, possibly with a few adjustments over teh day to day. So rather than writing a new list each night you could write out a list once and use it each day.

<h2>Data Accessing from Arrays and Objects:</h2>
<p>Javascript utilises "Objects" and "Arrays", both of which can hold different forms of data.<strong> Objects<strong> are a variable that can hold defined data lists, for example an object variable  called car can hold data for the car type, model and colour:
  <br><br>
  <code>var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};</code>
  <br><br>
    Accessing object data can be done by calling the object's properties or Key-values. Using the above example you could access it's data with the following:
  <br><br>
  <code>car.model or car["model"]</code>
  <br><br>
    Arrays can be used to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays can be nestled also, allowing multiple bits of data to be stored relative to a value.
  <br><br>
    <code>var car = ["Fiat", 500, "White"];</code>
  <br><br>
    Array data can be accessed by using the zero based numeric index, which value starts at [0] for the data entry.
  <br><br>
  <code>cars[0];</code> which would return <code>"Fiat"</code>
  <br><br>
</p>
<p>
Additionally, object data can be accessed using dot notation and bracket notation. Arrays rely solely on bracket notation.
</p>
<br>
<p>
<h2>Functions:</h2>
Functions are a type of coding structure that allow for variables and values to be taken in, computed, calculated, altered and returned to the user or input. The input and logical method are stored within a block of code. </p>
<p> Functions are great for repeating steps.
