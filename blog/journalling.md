<p>This practice is so simple, you may wonder if it does anything useful at all. I wondered the same thing the first time Norman Fischer explained it to me, but the research blew my mind. A study by Stefanie Spera, Eric Buhrfeind, and James Pennebaker had a group of laid-off professionals write to themselves about their feelings for five consecutive days for twenty minutes each day.10 These people found new jobs at a much higher rate than the people in the non-writing control group. After eight months, 68.4 percent of them found jobs, versus 27.3 percent from the control group. Those numbers just blew my mind. Usually, if an intervention can make a difference of a few percentage points, you can publish a paper. But here, we are not talking about 3 percentage points. We are talking about more than 40 percentage points! And all it took was one hundred minutes of intervention. Oh, wow.</p>

<p>Four minutes can make a measurable difference. That exploding sound is the sound of my mind being blown.
One fun way of having a daily journaling practice is to write a different prompt on each piece of paper, put them all in a fishbowl (a dry one, I recommend), then pick out one or two at random each day. Here are some suggested prompts:

• What I am feeling now is…

• I am aware that…

• What motivates me is…

• I am inspired by…

• Today, I aspire to…

• What hurts me is…

• I wish…

• Others are…

• I made a happy mistake…

• Love is…

 <h1>JOURNALING FOR SELF-ASSESSMENT</h1>

Prime


Before we begin journaling, let’s prime the mind.
Let’s spend 2 minutes thinking about one or more instances in which you responded positively to a challenging situation and the outcome was very satisfying to you. You felt you did great. If you are considering more than one instance, think about whether any connections or patterns are emerging.
Now, let’s take a moment to relax mentally.

• My strengths are…

Now let’s spend 2 minutes thinking about one or more instances in which you responded negatively to a challenging situation and the outcome was very unsatisfying to you. You felt that you performed badly, and you wish there were something you could change. If you are considering more than one instance, think about whether any connections or patterns are emerging.
Now, let’s take a moment to relax mentally.

Take a few minutes to read what you wrote to yourself.
