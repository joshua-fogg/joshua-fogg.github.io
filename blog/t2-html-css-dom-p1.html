      <h2>Html, CSS and DOM:</h2>
    <p>
      Generally people tend to relate this to a house. So lets imagine we are building a house.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      So when a house is built the first things that go in are the foundations, timber framing and roof, with this we know we are dealing with a housing site. It gives us a layout for where to place the rest of the pieces and lets us know what we are dealing with. In a website this is <strong>HTML</strong>. It packages everything together and gives it a place.
    </li> </ul>

      Now that we have somewhere to build walls and put furniture lets look at the next layer.
    <ul><li>
      <strong> CSS </strong> is the equivalent to the interior styling, the types of walls, wall paper, paint, carpet and furniture within the house. It gives the look and feel of the place.
    </li></ul>
      Now we have a house with a roof, walls and a decorated interior.

      <ul><li>

        So now we are ready to make the house more interactive, so we can play around and adjust things like how brihgt a room is or if a gamming console will be workable. THis is where <b>DOM</b> comes in. DOM being short for 'Document Object Model.' This is a tool used by developers to edit and test code in situ. This would be the switches or blinds in the house that people can interact with to instantly change or tinker with the properties of aspects like lighting and airflow or background noise.

      </li>
  </ul>
  </div>

      <h2> Boxifying Design </h2>
      <p>Boxifying design is where a page is broken down or built up into layered boxes to allow the designer to give spaces and limitations on design elements. It allows for a clear thought process of how parts will lie next to eachother.</p>
  </div>
  <div>

    <h2> Box model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The box model is used to describe design and layout. It allows designers to describe how they want elements in the box to be treated. For example a box is made out of the inner content, padding, boarders and lastly margins. By affecting these elements of the box we can create different design layouts.
    </li>
  </ul>
